# 🏥 HospitalLogic – Patient Data Analysis using SQL

This project is an end-to-end SQL analysis on a healthcare dataset containing patient information such as demographics, medical conditions, hospital stays, billing, and more. It was built as part of my data analytics portfolio to demonstrate intermediate-level SQL querying, analysis, and business insight extraction.

## 📂 Dataset Overview

The dataset includes the following columns:
- `Name`, `Age`, `Gender`, `Blood Type`,
- `Medical Condition`, `Date of Admission`,
- `Doctor`, `Hospital`, `Insurance provider`, `Billing Amount`, `Room Number`,
- `Admission Type`, `Discharge Date`,
- `Medication`, `Test Results`

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Understand patient demographics and distribution.
- Identify most common medical conditions and patterns.
- Analyze hospital billing and stay duration.
- Extract actionable insights from admissions data.
