# 🏥 HospitalLogic – Patient Data Analysis using SQL

This project is an end-to-end SQL analysis on a healthcare dataset containing patient information such as demographics, medical conditions, hospital stays, billing, and more. It was built as part of my data analytics portfolio to demonstrate intermediate-level SQL querying, analysis, and business insight extraction.

## 📂 Dataset Overview

The dataset includes the following columns:
- `Name`, `Age`, `Gender`, `Blood Type`,
- `Medical Condition`, `Date of Admission`,
- `Doctor`, `Hospital`, `Insurance provider`,
- `Billing Amount`, `Room Number`,
- `Admission Type`, `Discharge Date`,
- `Medication`, `Test Results`


📂 Dataset
The project uses a real-world healthcare dataset containing 55,000+ patient records with the following fields:

Name, Age, Gender, Blood Type, Medical Condition, Date of Admission, Doctor, Hospital, Insurance Provider, Billing Amount, Room Number, Admission Type, Discharge Date, Medication, Test Results

🗂️ File Name: healthcare_data.csv
📁 Location: Dataset/ folder
📦 Size: ~8 MB
📄 Format: CSV (Comma-Separated Values)

Note: Due to the large size, GitHub may render the dataset in raw format. A preview of a few sample rows is shown below.
